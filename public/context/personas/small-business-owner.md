# Small Business Owner

## Background
I own and operate a growing regional accounting firm with 35 employees across two locations that I've built over the past 12 years. My professional background is in accounting and business management, with no formal IT training. I make all major business decisions including technology investments, though I recently hired a part-time IT consultant who visits once a week. I'm directly responsible for our business continuity, client data security, and technology budget.

## Technical Knowledge
My technical knowledge is basic and practical rather than formal. I understand general concepts like cloud services, Wi-Fi, firewalls, and basic security practices, but I don't know specific technical implementations or industry terminology. I can follow guided instructions for simple network tasks but rely on outside help for anything complex. I use technology daily (PC, smartphone, accounting software) but don't understand the underlying infrastructure. I recognize the importance of cybersecurity for my client data but don't know how to implement proper protections beyond basic antivirus software.

## Business Context
My business operates on narrow margins with careful cost management. I handle highly sensitive financial information for clients, making security and confidentiality paramount concerns. My technology decisions are driven by:
- Immediate business needs and client service requirements
- Regulatory compliance (confidential financial data protection)
- Budget constraints (typically under $25,000 for IT annually)
- Reliability requirements (downtime directly impacts revenue)
- Simplicity of management (with minimal technical staff)
- Growth accommodation (planning to add 10-15 employees next year)

## Communication Preferences
I prefer explanations that focus on business outcomes and practical impacts rather than technical details. I appreciate when complex concepts are related to familiar business analogies or examples. I need to understand costs (both immediate and ongoing) and return on investment for any proposed solutions. Visual demonstrations or simple diagrams help me grasp technical concepts. I value straightforward language that avoids unnecessary technical jargon, and I respond well to options presented with clear tradeoffs rather than a single recommendation.

## Pain Points & Challenges
- **Technology Overwhelm**: Too many options without clear differentiation
- **Security Concerns**: Protecting client financial data with limited expertise
- **Reliability Issues**: Current network occasionally experiences outages
- **Growth Planning**: Ensuring infrastructure can scale with business
- **Cost Management**: Balancing upfront costs against long-term needs
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Meeting industry requirements for data protection
- **Productivity Impact**: Minimizing disruption during technology changes
- **Support Dependency**: Limited internal capabilities for troubleshooting

## Goals & Motivations
- Create a reliable technology foundation that supports business growth
- Protect sensitive client financial data from breaches or leaks
- Minimize unexpected technology expenses and support costs
- Improve employee productivity through better tech infrastructure
- Reduce frequency of IT issues that require external support
- Implement appropriate backup and disaster recovery capabilities
- Understand enough about our network to make informed decisions
