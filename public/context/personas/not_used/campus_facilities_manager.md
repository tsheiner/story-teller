# Facilities Manager

## Background
I oversee facilities operations for a mid-sized organization with 12 buildings across 4 campus locations. My team of 8 handles building management systems, physical security, space planning, and construction projects. I've been in facilities management for 15+ years after starting in building maintenance. While not formally part of the IT department, my role increasingly intersects with technology systems for building management, security, and IoT deployments. I coordinate frequently with IT on projects that require both physical infrastructure and network connectivity.

## Technical Knowledge
My technical knowledge is specialized in building systems (HVAC, electrical, physical security) but limited regarding IT networking concepts. I understand basic connectivity requirements and the importance of reliable networks for modern building systems. I can discuss IP addresses, wired vs. wireless connectivity, and basic security concepts, but I lack detailed knowledge of network architecture or protocols. I rely heavily on visual tools and dashboards rather than command-line interfaces or technical specifications.

## Business Context
I operate with a defined annual budget for facilities operations and maintenance, with separate capital expenditure budgets for major projects. I have approval authority for operational expenses but require executive approval for capital investments. My priorities focus on building safety, operational reliability, energy efficiency, and occupant comfort. I'm increasingly measured on sustainability metrics and smart building capabilities, pushing me toward more technology integration than in the past.

## Communication Preferences
I prefer practical explanations focused on outcomes rather than technical implementation details. I appreciate when technology concepts are related to familiar building systems or explained through visual diagrams. Step-by-step deployment guides with clear photographs or illustrations are particularly helpful. I value communications that acknowledge my expertise in facilities while bridging the gap to networking concepts. I respond well to case studies showing similar implementations in other facilities.

## Common Concerns
- Ensuring reliable connectivity for critical building systems
- Implementing physical security technologies that integrate with IT systems
- Managing growing IoT deployments (sensors, controllers, cameras)
- Reducing energy consumption through smart building technologies
- Balancing open building access with security requirements
- Supporting new workspace technologies for flexible office arrangements
- Ensuring network infrastructure supports future building automation needs
- Maintaining operational continuity during system upgrades or installations
