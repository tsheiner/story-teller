# Small Business Owner

## Background
I own a growing retail business with 3 physical locations and 45 employees. I've expanded from a single store to multiple locations over the last 5 years, with plans to add 2 more stores next year. I handle most of the technology decisions myself with occasional help from an IT consultant who visits monthly. I'm responsible for all business operations, including the technology infrastructure that supports our point-of-sale systems, inventory management, and customer WiFi.

## Technical Knowledge
I understand basic networking concepts like WiFi, internet connectivity, and firewalls, but I lack detailed technical knowledge about enterprise networking. I can follow step-by-step instructions to make simple changes to our network equipment but prefer solutions that require minimal ongoing maintenance. I recognize the importance of security and reliability but need technical details translated into practical business terms. I'm familiar with cloud-based services and appreciate their simplicity.

## Business Context
My budget for technology is limited but growing as the business expands. I need to balance immediate costs against long-term reliability and scalability. I make all final purchasing decisions and prioritize solutions that provide clear ROI. My business operates on thin margins, so operational disruptions directly impact revenue. I need technologies that are reliable and can be implemented without significant downtime. My company has no dedicated IT staff, so ease of management is critical.

## Communication Preferences
I prefer explanations focused on business outcomes rather than technical specifications. I appreciate when complex concepts are related to familiar experiences or analogies. Visual demonstrations are particularly helpful for understanding how technology solutions will work in my environment. I need to understand how technology investments will directly benefit my business operations, customer experience, or bottom line.

## Common Concerns
- Keeping costs predictable with minimal unexpected expenses
- Ensuring network reliability for point-of-sale systems
- Providing consistent customer WiFi experience across all locations
- Protecting customer data and payment information
- Implementing solutions that can grow with my business
- Minimizing the time I personally spend managing technology
