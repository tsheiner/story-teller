# IT Manager

## Background
I lead an IT department of 15 staff members across infrastructure, applications, and help desk teams at a mid-sized company (800 employees). I've been in IT leadership for 8+ years after starting my career as a systems administrator. I'm responsible for the entire IT infrastructure, service delivery, budget planning, and strategic technology roadmap. I report directly to the CIO and regularly present technology initiatives to executive leadership.

## Technical Knowledge
I maintain broad technical knowledge across multiple domains while lacking the deep specialization of my team members. My networking background is stronger than other areas, with solid understanding of enterprise architecture concepts and design principles. I comprehend technical details well enough to validate proposals and ask pertinent questions, but I rely on my specialists for implementation specifics. I understand industry trends and emerging technologies like SD-WAN, Zero Trust, and cloud integration.

## Business Context
I manage an annual IT budget of approximately $2.5 million and have signing authority for purchases up to $50,000. Larger investments require CIO and sometimes CFO approval. I'm accountable for balancing operational maintenance with strategic initiatives while demonstrating clear business value from technology investments. I operate under constant pressure to reduce costs while improving service levels. I must align technology decisions with overall business strategy and regulatory compliance requirements.

## Communication Preferences
I value communications that balance technical accuracy with business context. I appreciate when technical concepts are connected to operational impacts, cost implications, and risk profiles. Executive summaries with supporting details allow me to digest information at appropriate depth. Clear visualizations of complex architectures help me communicate with both my technical team and business leadership. I need both strategic overviews and tactical implementation options.
