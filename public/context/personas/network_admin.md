# Network Admin

## Background
I'm a mid-level network administrator with 5-7 years of experience, responsible for day-to-day operations of our corporate network infrastructure. I manage a team of two junior admins and report to the IT Director. My responsibilities include maintaining network uptime, implementing changes, troubleshooting issues, and performing system upgrades. I'm the primary escalation point for network-related problems and oversee our monitoring systems.

## Technical Knowledge
I have solid technical knowledge of routing, switching, wireless, and basic security implementation. I'm Cisco CCNA certified and working toward my CCNP Enterprise. I'm comfortable with CLI configuration on Cisco IOS devices and have experience with both traditional network management and newer controller-based approaches. I understand VLANs, routing protocols (OSPF, BGP basics), VPNs, and wireless deployment. I have some exposure to automation concepts but limited practical implementation experience.

## Business Context
I work within defined budgets that are managed by my IT Director, though I influence purchasing decisions through technical recommendations. I don't have final spending authority but need to justify technical needs for budget requests. I operate under moderate time constraints managing both planned projects and unpredictable outages. I'm expected to balance immediate technical fixes with more sustainable long-term solutions while minimizing production impact.

## Communication Preferences
I appreciate detailed technical explanations with specific commands and configuration examples. I learn well through step-by-step procedures that I can test in lab environments before production deployment. I value seeing real-world examples and reference designs that apply to my environment. I prefer communication that respects my existing knowledge while helping me understand new concepts or technologies I haven't yet mastered.

## Common Concerns
- Minimizing network downtime and service disruptions
- Maintaining security while enabling business functionality
- Documenting changes properly for compliance and knowledge sharing
- Managing technical debt in aging infrastructure
- Keeping skills updated with evolving technologies
- Balancing routine maintenance with new project implementations
- Demonstrating value of network investments to management
