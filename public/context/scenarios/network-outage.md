# Network Outage Scenario

## Situation Overview
A critical network outage is currently affecting core business operations. The incident began approximately 45 minutes ago with users reporting complete loss of connectivity to key applications. Initial monitoring shows multiple systems are unreachable and business operations are severely impacted. The outage appears to be widespread rather than isolated to a specific segment. Support tickets are rapidly increasing, and executive management is requesting urgent updates on resolution timeline.

## Current Symptoms
- Multiple critical business applications are inaccessible
- Internet connectivity is sporadic or completely down
- Internal services (file shares, printers, etc.) are unreachable
- VoIP phone system is non-functional
- Remote users cannot establish VPN connections
- Monitoring systems show significant packet loss across core infrastructure

## Initial Investigation Findings
- Network management systems show core switches in an error state
- Several key network devices are unreachable via management interfaces
- Last configuration change was implemented 12 hours ago (ACL update on core firewall)
- No scheduled maintenance was planned for this period
- No apparent environmental issues (power, cooling, etc.) have been reported
- Security monitoring has not identified any obvious attack patterns
- Partial connectivity exists in some network segments

## Business Impact
- Customer-facing operations have ceased
- Order processing systems are inaccessible
- Production lines/business operations have stopped
- Remote workers cannot access company resources
- Communication systems (email, chat, phones) are severely degraded
- Estimated financial impact is significant and increasing with outage duration

## Available Resources
- Network topology documentation is available but may not reflect recent changes
- Monitoring system historical data for the past 72 hours is accessible
- Remote access to functioning network devices is available
- Backup configurations for all devices are stored off-network
- Team members with various expertise levels are online and ready to assist
- Vendor support contracts are active and can be escalated if needed

## Immediate Priorities
- Restore critical business functionality as quickly as possible
- Identify the root cause to ensure full resolution
- Implement temporary workarounds if possible
- Communicate status updates to stakeholders
- Document the incident timeline and response actions
- Prevent recurrence through appropriate remediation

## Constraints
- Changes must follow emergency change control procedures
- Security posture cannot be compromised to restore service
- Limited maintenance window for implementing changes
- Team members have varying levels of expertise and authorization
- Some systems may require vendor involvement for support
