# Network Performance Issues

## Situation Overview
Westfield Manufacturing is experiencing significant network performance degradation across their main production facility. The issues began approximately three weeks ago and have progressively worsened, with intermittent connectivity drops, application timeouts, and unusually slow file transfers. The production environment depends on network-connected machinery and automated systems, so these problems are directly impacting manufacturing output and efficiency. Management has escalated this as a critical priority requiring immediate resolution.

## Specific Details
- **Company Profile**: Mid-sized manufacturing company with 450 employees
- **Facility**: 175,000 sq ft manufacturing facility with attached 3-story office building
- **Network Scale**: ~750 connected devices (computers, phones, IoT sensors, production equipment)
- **Infrastructure Age**: Core switching infrastructure is 5-7 years old; Access switches 3-4 years old
- **Recent Changes**: New ERP system deployed 1 month ago; New production line added 2 months ago; Firmware updates to wireless controllers 3 weeks ago
- **Support Status**: Basic 8x5 support contract with local VAR; No proactive monitoring solution

## Technical Requirements
- **Problem Scope**: Determine if issues are isolated to specific network segments or facility-wide
- **Performance Baseline**: Establish normal vs. current performance metrics
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Identify underlying causes rather than just symptoms
- **Monitoring Solution**: Implement appropriate tools to prevent future occurrences
- **Remediation Plan**: Develop both immediate fixes and long-term recommendations
- **Documentation**: Provide detailed documentation of findings and solutions
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Ensure IT staff understands the issues and resolution

## Business Constraints
- **Production Impact**: Current issues causing approximately $30,000/day in lost production
- **Maintenance Windows**: Production runs 24/5 with limited weekend maintenance windows
- **Budget Limitations**: Unplanned emergency budget of $45,000 available for immediate fixes
- **Staffing**: Limited on-site IT expertise (2 generalists with basic networking knowledge)
- **Vendor Access**: Physical and remote access must follow strict security protocols
- **Timeline Pressure**: Management expects significant improvement within 3 business days

## Success Criteria
- Identify and document clear root causes for the performance issues
- Restore network performance to pre-incident levels or better
- Implement reliable monitoring to prevent similar future incidents
- Provide performance metrics before and after remediation
- Complete work with minimal additional production disruption
- Deliver knowledge transfer to internal IT staff
- Establish clear performance baselines for future reference
- Document recommendations for infrastructure improvements that would prevent recurrence
