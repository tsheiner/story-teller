# Guest Network Deployment

## Situation Overview
The Ridgeway Hotel Group is undertaking a comprehensive guest Wi-Fi modernization project across their portfolio of 12 boutique hotels. Their current guest internet infrastructure, implemented 6 years ago, has become a significant source of guest complaints due to poor coverage, inconsistent performance, and cumbersome login processes. Management has prioritized this initiative after negative reviews citing Wi-Fi issues began impacting bookings and revenue. The project seeks to create a premium guest connectivity experience while enabling new digital guest services planned for the coming year.

## Specific Details
- **Organization**: Upscale hotel chain with 12 properties (45-180 rooms each)
- **Property Types**: Mix of modern and historic buildings, including some with thick stone/brick walls
- **Guest Profile**: Primarily business travelers and affluent leisure guests with high expectations
- **Device Density**: Average 3.5 connected devices per guest, peak occupancy events
- **Current Infrastructure**: Aging autonomous APs with limited coverage, property-specific implementations
- **Staff Usage**: 25-40 staff per property also requiring wireless connectivity
- **Applications**: Standard internet use, HD streaming, video conferencing, hotel guest app

## Technical Requirements
- **Coverage**: 100% reliable connectivity in all guest rooms, public areas, and meeting spaces
- **Performance**: Support for HD video streaming to multiple devices simultaneously
- **Density**: Handle 500+ concurrent connections during conferences/events at larger properties
- **Onboarding**: Simple, intuitive guest authentication with multiple options (room number, social, email)
- **Segmentation**: Separate networks for guests, staff, management, and building systems
- **Analytics**: Guest usage patterns, location services, and engagement metrics
- **Management**: Centralized cloud management across all properties
- **Integration**: API capability for integration with property management and guest service systems
- **Scalability**: Support for IoT expansion (smart room features planned for next year)

## Business Constraints
- **Budget**: $1.1 million total allocated across all properties
- **Implementation Timeline**: Complete all properties within 6 months, prioritizing locations with lowest guest satisfaction scores
- **Operational Impact**: Minimal disruption to guest experience during installation
- **Staffing**: Limited technical staff at each property (typically 1-2 IT-capable employees)
- **Revenue Opportunities**: Solution should support potential for tiered service offerings
- **Brand Standards**: Consistent look, feel, and performance across all properties
- **Marketing Relaunch**: Marketing campaign for new "premium connectivity" scheduled for Q3

## Success Criteria
- Minimum 50% reduction in Wi-Fi related guest complaints within first month
- 98% or better coverage in all guest areas verified by post-installation surveys
- Simplified connection process requiring fewer than 3 steps for guests
- Centralized visibility and management for corporate IT team
- Consistent branding and user experience across all properties
- Scalable foundation for planned IoT and guest service applications
- Detailed analytics enabling better understanding of guest behavior and usage patterns
- Successful implementation with minimal guest disruption during installation process
