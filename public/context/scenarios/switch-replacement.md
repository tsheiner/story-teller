# Routine Maintenance: Switch Replacement

## Situation Overview
A scheduled network maintenance window has been approved to replace an aging access switch that is approaching end-of-support status. The switch serves a department of 25 users along with several networked printers and a few specialized devices. The maintenance has been planned for a week and is scheduled to occur during non-business hours this weekend. This is routine preventative maintenance rather than an emergency replacement, providing time for proper planning and execution.

## Equipment Details
- **Current Switch**: 5-year-old 48-port access switch
  - Model reaching end-of-support next quarter
  - Running older firmware version (2 major versions behind)
  - Experiencing occasional port failures
  - Current configuration includes multiple VLANs and specific port settings
  
- **Replacement Switch**: New enterprise access switch
  - Higher port density (48 ports with PoE capabilities)
  - Latest firmware pre-installed
  - Additional features not present in the older model
  - Different command syntax for some configuration elements

## Maintenance Objectives
- Replace the physical hardware with minimal disruption
- Accurately transfer all configuration elements to the new device
- Verify full functionality of all connected devices post-migration
- Update documentation to reflect the new equipment
- Ensure proper monitoring is configured for the new device
- Complete the work within the approved maintenance window

## Available Resources
- Complete network topology documentation
- Backup of the current switch configuration
- Spare network cables and optics
- Physical access to the network closet arranged
- Remote access to network monitoring systems
- Change management ticket approved with rollback plan

## Implementation Considerations
- Configuration differences between old and new switch models
- Device-specific settings that need to be preserved (VLANs, port security, etc.)
- Potential firmware compatibility issues with other network equipment
- Special requirements for particular devices (like VoIP phones or security cameras)
- Ensuring proper cable management during installation
- Testing procedures to verify successful implementation
- Documentation updates needed after completion

## Success Criteria
- All users and devices regain full network connectivity
- No unexpected disruption outside the maintenance window
- All VLANs and specialized configurations properly transferred
- No security or performance degradation after replacement
- Updated network documentation and inventory
- Proper disposal or reassignment of the old equipment
- Verified monitoring and alerting for the new device

## Stakeholder Communication
- Maintenance notification has been sent to affected departments
- IT leadership has approved the change management request
- Helpdesk has been informed about potential user impact
- Vendor support contacts are available if needed
- Post-maintenance verification stakeholders identified
