# Security Incident Response

## Situation Overview
Regional Health System has detected suspicious network traffic patterns suggesting a potential security breach in progress. Their security monitoring system flagged unusual outbound data transfers from servers in their billing department at 2:30 AM, outside normal operation hours. The CISO has activated the incident response plan and assembled a team to investigate, contain the potential threat, and remediate any vulnerabilities while maintaining critical patient care systems. This is occurring against the backdrop of recent healthcare ransomware attacks in their region.

## Specific Details
- **Organization**: Healthcare system with 3 hospitals, 12 clinics, 4,500 employees
- **Network Scale**: 6,000+ endpoints, 250+ servers, 120+ network devices across 15 locations
- **Infrastructure**: Cisco Catalyst campus network, Meraki at smaller clinics, Firepower NGFW
- **Detection Source**: Unusual outbound encrypted traffic detected by Stealthwatch
- **Affected Systems**: Initial indicators point to 3 servers in billing department subnet
- **Current Status**: Suspicious servers have been isolated but investigation is still underway
- **Data Sensitivity**: Systems contain protected health information (PHI) and financial data
- **Regulatory Environment**: Subject to HIPAA, HITECH, and PCI compliance requirements

## Technical Requirements
- **Incident Triage**: Confirm breach status and determine scope of compromise
- **Containment Strategy**: Implement appropriate isolation without disrupting critical care
- **Forensic Investigation**: Determine attack vector, affected systems, and potential data exposure
- **IOC Identification**: Develop indicators of compromise to scan other systems
- **Traffic Analysis**: Review historical and current network traffic patterns
- **Security Posture**: Identify and address vulnerabilities that enabled the incident
- **Recovery Plan**: Develop clean recovery approach for affected systems

## Business Constraints
- **Operational Impact**: Cannot disrupt critical patient care systems (EMR, PACS, etc.)
- **Communication Channels**: Email has been temporarily disabled as a precaution
- **Regulatory Requirements**: Must comply with breach notification requirements if PHI exposed
- **Public Relations**: Hospital board concerned about reputation damage
- **Resource Availability**: Limited after-hours IT security staff (2 on-call personnel)
- **Time Pressure**: Must determine breach scope within 24 hours to meet reporting obligations
- **Authentication Systems**: Two-factor authentication temporarily unavailable for some systems

## Success Criteria
- Accurate determination of breach status and scope
- Containment of threat without disruption to critical patient care
- Complete identification of compromised systems and attack vectors
- Thorough documentation of incident timeline and response actions
- Clear remediation steps with implementation plan and verification
- Actionable recommendations to prevent similar incidents
- Compliant approach to regulatory notification requirements (if applicable)
- Appropriate communication materials for internal and potential external use
