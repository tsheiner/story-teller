# Compliance Preparation

## Situation Overview
MidWest Financial Services, a regional financial institution with $4.2 billion in assets, is preparing for an upcoming regulatory examination that will heavily scrutinize their network security controls and compliance posture. Recent high-profile breaches in the financial sector have prompted regulators to intensify their focus on cybersecurity practices. The company's CISO has been tasked with ensuring their network infrastructure, security controls, and documentation meet all regulatory requirements. With the examination scheduled in 90 days, the organization needs to identify and remediate any compliance gaps in their networking infrastructure.

## Specific Details
- **Organization Profile**: Regional financial institution with 38 branch locations and 2 data centers
- **Regulatory Framework**: Subject to GLBA, PCI-DSS, SOX, and state banking regulations
- **Examination Scope**: Network segmentation, access controls, encryption, monitoring, incident response
- **Previous Findings**: Prior examination noted deficiencies in network segmentation and privileged access
- **Network Infrastructure**: Mix of Cisco Catalyst and Nexus switches, ASA and Firepower firewalls
- **Security Systems**: ISE for NAC, Stealthwatch for monitoring, Umbrella for DNS security
- **Documentation Status**: Policies exist but implementation evidence is inconsistently maintained
- **Recent Changes**: Cloud migration of several applications completed within past 6 months

## Technical Requirements
- **Segmentation Validation**: Verify effective separation between critical systems and general network
- **Access Control Review**: Evaluate and document all network access policies and enforcement mechanisms
- **Security Architecture**: Document current security controls with clear mapping to regulatory requirements
- **Monitoring Coverage**: Confirm comprehensive logging and alerting for security-relevant events
- **Vulnerability Management**: Verify remediation of all critical and high vulnerabilities
- **Configuration Compliance**: Ensure all network devices comply with security baselines
- **Encryption Implementation**: Validate encryption for data in transit across all critical communications
- **Incident Response Testing**: Validate detection and response capabilities for network-based attacks

## Business Constraints
- **Timeline**: All remediation must be completed 30 days before examination (60-day window)
- **Resource Limitations**: Security team of 5 with limited bandwidth due to concurrent projects
- **Change Control**: Strict change management requiring 7-day notice for production changes
- **Operational Impact**: Remediations cannot disrupt banking operations or customer services
- **Documentation Requirements**: All changes require extensive documentation for examiner review
- **Budget Constraints**: Limited to previously approved security budget with 15% contingency
- **Third-Party Dependencies**: Some applications managed by vendors with their own change cycles
- **Executive Visibility**: Weekly status reporting to C-suite on compliance readiness

## Success Criteria
- Clean examination with no major findings related to network security
- Complete, accurate documentation mapping controls to regulatory requirements
- Evidence packages prepared and organized for all control implementations
- Validated network segmentation with clear separation of duties
- Remediations implemented with minimal operational disruption
- Security monitoring demonstrating appropriate coverage and alerting
- Successfully executed tabletop exercises for incident response scenarios
- Sustainable compliance processes rather than one-time fixes
- Knowledge transfer ensuring all team members can explain controls to examiners
