# Legacy Infrastructure Upgrade

## Situation Overview
Hartman Industries, a specialty chemical manufacturer operating for over 35 years, has reached a critical juncture with their aging network infrastructure. Multiple network outages in the past quarter have disrupted production and order processing, prompting executive leadership to approve a comprehensive infrastructure modernization project. The current environment includes networking equipment ranging from 7-12 years old, much of which is approaching end-of-support status. The company needs to upgrade their infrastructure while minimizing disruption to their 24/7 manufacturing operations.

## Specific Details
- **Company Profile**: Mid-sized specialty chemical manufacturer with 620 employees
- **Locations**: Main campus (manufacturing, R&D, headquarters) plus 3 distribution centers
- **Current Infrastructure**: Catalyst 6500 core switches, Catalyst 3750 access switches, ASA 5500 firewalls, autonomous APs, multiple IOS versions
- **Environment Challenges**: Manufacturing floor has harsh conditions (heat, chemicals, dust)
- **Critical Applications**: ERP system, Manufacturing Execution System (MES), SCADA, QA systems
- **Documentation Status**: Limited and outdated network documentation
- **Compliance Requirements**: Must maintain segregation for industrial control systems

## Technical Requirements
- **Lifecycle Replacement**: Equipment refresh for end-of-support networking infrastructure
- **Performance Needs**: 10G backbone, minimum 1G to access points and workstations
- **Redundancy**: Eliminate single points of failure in the network architecture
- **Wireless Coverage**: Modern wireless supporting manufacturing applications and BYOD
- **Security**: Segmentation between IT, OT, guest, and business-critical systems
- **Management**: Centralized visibility and control across all locations
- **Industrial Requirements**: Support for specialized industrial protocols and IoT devices
- **Migration Plan**: Phased approach that minimizes production impact

## Business Constraints
- **Budget**: $1.2 million capital expenditure approved for network infrastructure
- **Timeline**: Complete project within 12 months, with critical areas prioritized
- **Maintenance Windows**: Production lines can only be taken offline during scheduled maintenance periods (typically one weekend per month)
- **Resource Limitations**: Small internal IT team (5 staff) with limited Cisco expertise
- **Business Continuity**: Zero tolerance for unplanned outages affecting manufacturing
- **Future Planning**: Solution must support 5-year growth plan with minimal additional investment
- **ROI Expectations**: Executive team expects demonstrable improvements in uptime and performance

## Success Criteria
- Zero unplanned production downtime during implementation
- Fully redundant network core with no single points of failure
- 99.99% uptime or better for critical manufacturing systems
- Comprehensive network documentation and updated diagrams
- Centralized management capability across all locations
- Segmented environment meeting security and compliance requirements
- Knowledge transfer to internal IT team for ongoing operations
- Clear metrics demonstrating performance improvements over previous infrastructure
