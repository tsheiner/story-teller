# Multi-Site Connectivity

## Situation Overview
GlobalTech Solutions, a rapidly growing technology consulting firm, is transforming their WAN architecture to support changing business requirements. Through recent acquisitions and organic growth, they've expanded from 5 to 18 locations across North America and Europe in just 30 months. Their current connectivity model—a hub-and-spoke MPLS network with centralized internet breakout—is causing application performance issues, limiting cloud adoption, and significantly increasing costs as they add locations. They need a modern WAN solution that improves application performance, simplifies management, and provides a flexible foundation for continued global expansion.

## Specific Details
- **Company Profile**: Technology consulting firm with 2,800 employees across 18 locations
- **Office Distribution**: Headquarters (450 users), 3 regional offices (200-300 users each), 14 branch offices (50-150 users each)
- **Current Infrastructure**: MPLS primary connections to all sites with backup internet VPN
- **Traffic Profile**: Growing cloud application usage (Microsoft 365, Salesforce, AWS, Azure)
- **Bandwidth Requirements**: HQ: 1Gbps, Regional: 500Mbps, Branches: 100-200Mbps
- **Acquisition Roadmap**: 3 additional companies planned for acquisition in next 12 months
- **Global Expansion**: APAC market entry planned with 2 new offices next year

## Technical Requirements
- **Application Performance**: Optimize routing for cloud and SaaS applications
- **Global Connectivity**: Secure, reliable connectivity between all locations
- **Transport Flexibility**: Ability to leverage multiple connection types (MPLS, broadband, LTE)
- **Direct Cloud Access**: Secure local internet breakout where appropriate
- **Security**: Consistent security policy enforcement across all locations
- **Visibility**: End-to-end application performance monitoring and troubleshooting
- **Automation**: Simplified deployment for new locations and policy changes
- **QoS**: Critical application prioritization, particularly for voice and video
- **Integration**: Compatibility with existing Cisco infrastructure at most locations

## Business Constraints
- **Budget Concerns**: Current MPLS costs exceeding $1.2M annually and growing
- **IT Resources**: Lean IT team of 15 staff supporting global infrastructure
- **Timeline Pressure**: Must integrate 2 recent acquisitions within 3 months
- **Legacy Applications**: Several critical applications still hosted in primary data center
- **Merger Variability**: Acquired companies have diverse networking equipment
- **Compliance Requirements**: Must maintain SOC 2 compliance for client data
- **Stakeholder Expectations**: Executive team demands improved performance metrics
- **Standardization Goal**: Create consistent branch infrastructure template

## Success Criteria
- Reduce per-site deployment time from weeks to days
- Decrease WAN operational costs by at least 20% while improving performance
- Establish scalable architecture that accommodates planned growth
- Improve cloud application performance by 40%+ as measured by end-user experience
- Enable local internet breakout with appropriate security controls
- Implement comprehensive visibility across all locations and connection types
- Create standardized, repeatable deployment model for new sites
- Maintain or improve reliability compared to current MPLS-only approach
