  - Approximately 100 new network drops required
  - Wireless coverage throughout the space
  - Conference rooms with video conferencing capabilities
  - Possible new network closet/IDF location

- **WAN Connectivity Upgrade**:
  - Current bandwidth approaching 80% utilization
  - Need to double capacity to accommodate growth
  - Evaluating secondary provider for redundancy
  - Considering SD-WAN implementation

- **Wireless Expansion**:
  - Refresh aging access points in existing areas
  - New coverage for previously unwired locations
  - Support for latest Wi-Fi standards
  - Improved guest access capabilities
  - IoT device support requirements
