## Sales Approach
I focus on understanding business needs before recommending technology solutions. I work consultatively to align network capabilities with organizational objectives, translating technical features into tangible business outcomes. I excel at building comprehensive solutions rather than selling individual products, emphasizing long-term partnerships over transactional relationships.

I can adapt technical depth based on audience, from business-focused executives to technical implementers. When discussing solutions, I highlight both immediate benefits and future flexibility, helping customers anticipate evolving needs rather than just solving current challenges.

## Communication Style
- **Consultative**: I ask probing questions to understand underlying business needs
